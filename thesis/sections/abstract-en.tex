\section*{Abstract}

In the thesis presented the methods of semidefinite programming and the problem of separability of density matrices, with presenting fundamental knowledge on linear algebra. The thesis includes the implementation of necessary tools formulating conditions for matrix separation based on available frameworks (e.g. SeDuMi and YALMIP packages in MATLAB/OCTAVE) and illustrated the use of these tools with proposed examples.

Tasks done:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Overview of the literature on semidefinite programming
    \item Introduction to quantum information
    \item Implementation of tools as scripts in MATLAB
    \item Documentation of scripts and examples of their applications
\end{enumerate}

\noindent \textbf{Keywords:} quantum information

\noindent \textbf{Field of science and keywords:} Computer and information sciences
